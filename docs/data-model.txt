1. ID field
In stead of _id of MongoDB type, I will use custom-id: a string composed of
  db-name: char(4)  # this can be used for each customer - 33 cupper cased
                    # [A-Z1-9] without I,O. Giving 33**4 = >1 million
                    # a seperate db for each customer, with these 4 char string
  category: char(2) # 33*33 = 1089 categories possible
  reserved: char(2) # open for future
  timestamp:c(13)   # mil sec from Date.getTime(). Time of creation.
This will be 21 char long.
When I do save, and this ID happen to be duplicate (within 1 milsec window,
two user save with the same db-name/cat/..), the fail error will trigger:
wait(1 milsec), and re-try.

Example:
  FT13I1XX1566665432092
  ^^^^                  -> customer(db) name
      ^^                -> Category
        ^^              -> reserved
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ -> time stamp from Date.getTime() - milisec count
---------------------------
General:
    Text-String: (TS)
        quoted string of ASCII. May have delimiter: |:| to be segmented into
        substrings.
        a substring may have, at its beginning, a locale mark: 'en:', 'zh:',..
        If this locale-mark is missing, a system-wide defined default language
        is taken to usage.
        The substring is b64-encoded from original description taken from
        real-world.
